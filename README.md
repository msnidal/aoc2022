# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my Python 3.11 solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

## Setup

My solutions are restricted to the Python library with two exceptions - I started using a package `parse` to parse the input files out of convenience, and also `colorama` for pretty printing in a couple of cases.

You can just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual env to install these.

## Running

Each day's solution is in a separate file, and are run from the main project directory.

For example you can run day 11 by running `python day10/signal.py`
